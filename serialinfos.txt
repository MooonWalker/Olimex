Things to keep in mind

    Only USART1 can operate with clocks up to 72 MHz while the rest can operate at 36 MHz maximum. 
	This is because USART1 can get full system clock while the others get half of that.
    USART1 is connected to the high speed APB2 bus while rest are connected to the lower speed APB1 bus. 
	Most communication peripherals are connected with APB1 bus.
    GPIO pins associated with USART hardware must be set as alternate function I/Os and 
	it should be enabled before the hardware modulesâ€™ use.
    TX pins should be set as low speed (2 MHz) AFIO push-pull outputs while RX pins should be 
	set as floating inputs. 
	RX pins can also be set as inputs with pull-ups or pull-downs if needed.
    If flow control is not used then the associated flow control pins can be left as GPIO pins. 
	For instance PA8, PA11 and PA12 of USART1 can be used as GPIO pins if flow control is not needed.
    USART/UART pins can be remapped using AFIO_MAPR register. By default, the default pins 
	like PA9 and PA10 for USART1 are used and not remapped elsewhere because this register is 
	by default cleared and hardware remapping is not enabled.
    In exception conditions, APB1RSTR and APB2RSTR registers can be used reset USART/UART hardware.
